I will be making changes to the task files, etc. to tidy them up somewhat, and to build some HTML templates for some various components, but this template will always run without you, the cloner, messing about with config.

##Behind a workplace proxy?

Copy the .typingsrc file from the Additional folder into c:\users\youraccountname and modify it to have your proxy address where it tells you, and you're away.
